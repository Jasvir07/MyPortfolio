        Greetings! I am Jasvir Singh, a recent graduate from Punjabi University
        Patiala, where I earned my degree in computer science. I have completed
        comprehensive training in JavaSE, which has equipped me with the skills
        to develop robust and scalable enterprise applications. <br />
        My academic background provided me with a strong foundation in computer
        science, and my JavaEE training has further refined my understanding of
        software development principles. Through hands-on projects and
        coursework, I gained practical experience with JavaEE technologies
        including core Java, MySQL, JDBC, Spring, Spring Boot, and more.<br />
        Now that my formal education and training are complete, I am committed
        to continuous learning and professional growth. I am enthusiastic about
        expanding my knowledge and expertise in JavaEE and related technologies,
        and I am excited about the opportunities to contribute to innovative
        software solutions.
